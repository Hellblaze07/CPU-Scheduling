# 📄 ThreadFlow: Adaptive CPU Scheduler Platform

ThreadFlow is an enterprise-grade educational web application designed to visualize and simulate Operating System CPU scheduling algorithms. It demonstrates an end-to-end full-stack pipeline that transforms low-level C systems programming into highly interactive, real-time React visualizations using a robust Node.js API bridge.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📍 High-Performance Native Simulation Engine
- Uses a compiled C binary to execute complex scheduling mathematics natively.
- Simulates FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin, and Adaptive Hybrid algorithms with zero UI blocking.

### 🧠 Deterministic Adaptive Hybrid Scheduler
- Replaces standard generic algorithms with a custom Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) implementation.
- Evaluates processes based on Class: REAL-TIME (Preemptive), INTERACTIVE (Adaptive Round Robin), and BATCH (SRTF).
- Provides strict starvation prevention via dynamic Aging (promoting BATCH processes to INTERACTIVE over time).

### 🛡️ Backend-Controlled Execution Pipeline
- Strict linear lifecycle: C decides → JSON records → React visualizes.
- Built with Node.js `child_process.spawn()` to guarantee secure, isolated execution of the C binary for every API request.

### 🧪 Automated Math Invariant Assessment
- Deterministic Python test suite evaluates CPU utilization, turnaround times, and Gantt contiguity.
- Memory-safe C execution enforced via AddressSanitizer (ASan) to prevent buffer overflows on large JSON payloads.

### 🔐 Secure Cross-Origin API
- Strict CORS policies lock down the Express API to the production Vercel domain.
- Payload size limitations enforce stability during massive 500-process stress tests.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hellblaze07/CPU-Scheduling.git
cd CPU-Scheduling
```

### 2. C Engine Setup
Requires GCC compiler. Compile the native engine:
```bash
cd scheduler
make
cd ..
```

### 3. Backend Setup
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
```
The Express API will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

### 4. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧠 How It Works

```text
User Configures Workload (Vercel Frontend)
│
▼
HTTP POST /api/simulate (Express Backend)
│
▼
Node.js spawns C Engine with JSON stdin
│
▼
C Engine calculates ticks, preemptions, & aging
│
▼
C Engine stdout: JSON Execution Trace
│
▼
Backend validates trace & returns HTTP 200 OK
│

React renders Animated Gantt Charts & Metrics
```

## 📈 Impact

This project demonstrates how low-level systems programming and strict deterministic algorithms can be modernized into a full-stack web application by:
- Bridging the gap between academic C programming and modern Next.js visualization.
- Preventing main-thread UI freezing by offloading heavy simulations to a native binary.
- Enforcing algorithmic correctness at the API level via dual-layer testing (Jest + Python).
- Creating structured, traceable pipelines from OS logic to user-facing analytics.

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Support for Multi-Core CPU Scheduling architectures (SMP).
- Export historical simulation data to Excel and CSV.
- Real-time WebSockets for massive simulations that exceed standard HTTP timeout limits.
- Interactive memory management and paging simulation integration.
